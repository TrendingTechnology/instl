# instl

> Instl can install GitHub projects on your machine. No setup required.

Instl is a CLI tool which detects the right release of a GitHub repository for your system.
It will download the detected release and install the asset files to your computer.
The repositories themself, don't need a setup to be installable with instl. They just need a default release with assets for multiple operating systems.'
